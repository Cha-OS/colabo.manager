View a Google Spreadsheet as a Gantt Chart

ezGantt uses public Google Chart and Google Drive JavaScript APIs, 
so the same users who can view the Spreadsheet can see the Gantt chart.
To try it, go to https://ezgantt.appspot.com/#1kYfoEFXW-psZ8AMy0Ne7wRMiM3umNKBs3v9U7nvafXA

To use it yourself, make a copy of the demo sheet and start adding tasks!
